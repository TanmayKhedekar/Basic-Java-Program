# ðŸ§µ DSA Pattern Problems â€“ Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet

Welcome to the **Pattern Problems** section of my DSA journey!  
This repository is a part of my learning and practice from the [Striver's A2Z DSA Course](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/must-do-pattern-problems-before-starting-dsa/), starting with mastering the fundamentals of pattern problems in programming.

## âœ… Topics Covered

This section includes solutions to **10 must-do pattern problems** which help in building logic for nested loops and understanding output formatting.

### ðŸŒŸ List of Pattern Problems

1. Square Star Pattern  
2. Right-Angled Triangle (Increasing)  
3. Right-Angled Triangle (Same Numbers)  
4. Right-Angled Triangle (Row Numbers)  
5. Inverted Right-Angled Triangle  
6. Inverted Triangle (Numbers)  
7. Triangle (Continuous Numbers)  
8. Triangle (Stars and Spaces)  
9. Pyramid Pattern  
10. Diamond Pattern  

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- Language:Java 
- IDE: VS Code / any
- Platform: Local machine and GitHub

- ## ðŸ“Œ Why Patterns?

- Improves control flow understanding (loops & conditions)
- Helps visualize logic and enhances problem-solving
- Serves as a great warm-up before diving into core DSA topics

## ðŸ§  What's Next?

After mastering these, Iâ€™ll be moving ahead to basic math, recursion, and arrays as per the A2Z roadmap. Stay tuned!
